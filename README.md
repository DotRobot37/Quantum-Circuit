# Quantum-Circuit
Intro to building quantum circuits. A Quantum Circuit is a model for Quantum Computing where a computation is a sequence of quantum gates.

The Hadamard Gate takes one Qubit & puts out a bit with equal probability of being 1 or 0.

The Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate takes 2 Qubits & flips one Qubit from a single state of ket 0 to ket 1 if the control Qubit is already ket 1. If not, it leaves the Qubit unchanged. 

If you choose to print the circuit to the console, you will see a circuit diagram.
